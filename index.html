<p> Hello! my name is Marcus N.H. Thompson and I am from Maricopa Arizona. I enjoy gaming, and watching tv. I work at a Circle K gas Station in the kitchen. I like swimming in the summer when the water is warmer, but not to warm. i like water that is just the right tempture for swimming. I also like baking, i can bake cakes, muffins, bread, cassaroles, corn bread, biscuts and triffles. i like to read books, i have read many books, all of which i have liked, or not liked. depending on what was writen inside of them, that is how i determin if i like a book based off of what is writen within its many pages. for that is really the only way to know if you will like a book or not anything else would really be just judging a book on something besides its own merit. </p>
